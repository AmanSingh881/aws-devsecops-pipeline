# AWS DevSecOps Pipeline

This project demonstrates a complete **DevSecOps pipeline** using **Jenkins**, **Packer**, and **Terraform** on **AWS Cloud Infrastructure**. The solution is designed for a **single development environment** in a **single AWS region**, focusing on automation, infrastructure as code, and security integration throughout the CI/CD lifecycle.

The goal is to automate the process of:
- Building secure and reusable base images
- Provisioning AWS infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable manner
- Running a secure CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys application code
- Integrating security controls at each layer

## 📌 Key Features

### 🔧 Secure AMI Creation using Packer
- Automates the creation of hardened Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
- Includes installation of required software, application dependencies, and system configurations
- Provides separate Packer templates for:
  - Application base images
  - Jenkins master node images

### ☁️ Infrastructure Provisioning using Terraform
- Uses Terraform to define and manage AWS infrastructure components
- Follows modular design principles to separate concerns (network, security, compute, etc.)
- Resources provisioned include:
  - VPC, subnets, route tables, and gateways
  - IAM roles and policies
  - Security groups and firewall rules
  - EC2 instances and Auto Scaling Groups
  - Load balancers for high availability

### 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins
- Jenkins is installed and configured on a dedicated EC2 instance using a prebuilt AMI
- Pipeline automates:
  - Source code checkout
  - Terraform validation and deployment
  - Application build and deployment to EC2
- Uses scripted pipelines or Jenkins Job DSL for flexibility and version control

### 📦 Application Deployment on AWS
- Application is deployed using an Auto Scaling Group with EC2 instances based on the custom-built AMI
- Load balancer distributes traffic among healthy instances
- AMI updates and deployments are integrated into the CI/CD process

### 🔐 DevSecOps Tools Integration *(To be finalized)*
- Security scanning tools and practices will be integrated throughout the build and deploy process
- Final tools will be added and documented as the project progresses

Stay tuned as the project evolves with complete examples, configurations, and security best practices for modern cloud-native deployments.
